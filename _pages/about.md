Dr. XiaoFeng Wang has been working on cybersecurity for more than two decades.  He is a Fellow of the ACM, IEEE and AAAS. He was a James H. Rudy Professor of Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering, Indiana University at Bloomington.  During the past 21 years, he also served IU in multiple administrative roles, including the Associate Dean for Research, a Co-Director of Center for Security and Privacy in Informatics, Computing and Engineering, and the Director of the Master of Science in Secure Computing (MSSC) program.

Nation-wide, Dr. Wang is the founder, and was the Director/Lead PI of Center for Distributed Confidential Computing (CDCC), a Frontiers Project in Secure and Trustworthy Computing funded by the National Science Foundation. The project is a multi-institution effort, involving faculty from IU (Lead), CMU, Duke, OSU, Penn State, Purdue, Spelman and Yale. The center aims at laying the technological foundations for practical data-in-use protection based on Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) over today and tomorrow’s cloud and edge platforms, which is critical to the advance of AI and data science.

Dr. Wang is currently the Chair of ACM Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC), and was also TPC Co-Chair of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), the ACM’s flagship security and privacy conference, during 2018 and 2019. In the past 20 years, Dr. Wang has been working on a broad range of research topics in systems security and data privacy. He is considered to be one of the most prominent systems security and privacy researchers, a top author according to online statistics such as [CSRankings](https://csrankings.org/#/fromyear/2014/toyear/2024/index?sec&us), [System Security Circus](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/security-circus/authors.html) (Eurecom), and [Top Authors, the Systems Cirus](https://nebelwelt.net/pubstats/top-authors-sys_sec.html) (EPFL). Dr. Wang is known for his high-impact research on security analysis of real-world systems and biomedical data privacy. Particularly, the projects he led on side-channel analysis and mitigation, payment and single-sign-on API integrations, Android and iOS security and IoT protection have changed the way the industry built computing systems. Also he is a pioneer researcher on human genome privacy and a co-founder of the iDASH Genome Privacy Competition that contributes to reducing the gap between security and cryptography research and real-world demands for biomedical data sharing and computing protection. More recently, he is actively working on TEE-based Data-in-Use protection for supporting AI, Trustworthy AI, and application of AI technologies (such as NLP and deep learning) to protect computing systems, LTE/5G networks in particular.

For his work, Dr. Wang has received numerous awards, including Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies (the PET Award), Best Practical Paper Award at the 32nd IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P; Oakland), and two Distinguished Paper Awards at the 26th Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS). His work has been extensively reported by public media, including CNN, MSNBC, Forbes, Slashdot, Nature News, etc. Dr. Wang’s research has been supported by NSF, NIH, ARO, IARPA, and other federal funding agencies and industry. Since joining IU in 2004, Dr. Wang has been serving as PI on research projects totaling nearly $23 million (by 2022).
